Title: Something's Started Happening in the Clouds of Neptune | Our Solar System's Planets | Channel: Astrum | Transcript:  Neptune is the smallest of the gas giants, and also the furthest away from the sun . It is the only planet found through mathematical prediction . Since Pluto's demotion to “not a planet” status, Neptune has been poorly understood as its distance from Earth and very small apparent size meant it couldn't be studied from ground-based telescopes .  Neptune has the fastest wind speed of any planet, with wind speeds blowing westward on the equator reaching a staggering 2,160kmph; nearly a supersonic flow . It takes a huge 165 years to orbit the sun once, which means we've only seen one neptunian year since its discovery .  When Voyager 2 passed by the planet in 1989, it saw the great dark spot, a storm about the size of Earth passing through its atmosphere . But why then doesn't uranus, which is very similar in composition and size to Neptune, also have such a blustery atmosphere?  Neptune's magnetic field is offset 47° relative to its rotational axis . It's only Uranus and Neptune that have such a tilted magnetosphere . Magnetic field is either not generated in core but by an electrically conducting liquid mantle .  Neptune does have a ring system, although it is very faint as it is not as dense and is extremely dark in colour . There are 5 known rings in all, and they're named after people involved in the discovery and research of Neptune . The innermost is the Galle ring, the first bright ring, Le Verrier, and the second is the Adams ring .  Neptune has 14 known moons, named after water deities in Greek mythology . Triton contains most of the mass of all of the moons put together . Proteus, Psamathe and Netho are the furthest out satellite of any planet that we know of to date .  Astronomer Norts has teamed up with Ground News to show an easy solution to all the misinformation surrounding space and science development . Norts on the planet Neptune: What planet would you like to see us do next?
Title: The Rainiest Place On Earth | Channel: Veritasium | Transcript:  This is the world's largest rainfall simulator, located in Tsukuba, Japan . Yakushima island near the southern part of Japan is one of the wettest places on Earth, receiving up to 10 meters of rain every year . The scientists can control the intensity of the rain from 15 millimeters per hour to 300 millimeter per hour .  There are two forces that act on a raindrop, gravity and air resistance, and the larger raindrops have a higher weight to surface area ratio . The size of the raindrop affects how fast it falls . in July, 2018, there were floods all over the country due to the rainfall from typhoon Prapiroon .  Researchers have identified over 700,000 places where landslides are a significant threat to homes . Japan is a very mountainous country with many towns and villages situated in valleys . The complexity of the physics of landslides is why the research is so important .  Petr filmed on location in Japan and he used NordVPN to safely access public wifi hotspots . NordVPN hides your IP address and helps protect your online identity . Petr: "The best way to minimize landslide damage is prevention, and it's the same for cybersecurity"  Rainfall simulator moves one meter per one minute . Water is actually an anti lubricant for many materials, including quartz, which is our most common mineral in soils and on earth .  There has been a tenfold increase in landslides in the forests of British Columbia in the last few decades . Trees are incredibly effective at preventing landslides . Scientists say humans are really good at causing landslides and we're shaping the land more quickly than geologic processes do .  The world's largest rainfall simulator is used to test how drones fly in rainy and windy conditions . The simulator is also used to improve the hardware and software of how the cars detect various objects .
Title: What's going on with Windows Laptops? | Channel: Marques Brownlee | Transcript:  Microsoft surface laptop has a new Intel chip and AMD chip inside, meaning it is an ARM laptop . Apple went through this transition from Intel chips to ARM chips and it was crazy successful, like, no one could really match their efficiency and seamless integration . The big advantage, the mega quantum leap forward was inefficiency .  This is a $2,000 14-inch laptop that can basically do anything I ask of it without breaking a sweat . It's getting compared a lot to the m3 13-inch macBook air and it even outlasts it on some synthetic benchmarks, which is awesome . I found the track pad gestures are pretty smooth, the graphics of the whole UI in general are consistent .  Apple did a lot of work trying to get developers onboard to get their apps optimized on ARM . Photoshop and lightroom CC run native, Chrome, Spotify, prime video, dropbox, zoom . There's a long list of apps in this sort of limbo phase where you don't know if there's an arm native app around the corner .  There are just apps that straight up don't work at all yet . Some apps that actually are compatible, but their websites for the companies that make them don't actually highlight or prominently show the download for the ARM version, so it's hard to find .  I love the all metal design, the keyboard's rock solid, big track pad with excellent haptics, and just really good fundamentals all around . My only real downside I would say with it getting as pricey as it can get is that there is no oled option . It's not, like, it's not like a super high-end gaming PC .  Dbrand's x--ray line lets you see basically every single component inside your device . Dbrand took hundreds of devices to a metrology lab and literally shot each one of them with a special x-ray machine for maximum accuracy .
Title: Can AI really save the World? ft. Bill Gates | Channel: Mrwhosetheboss | Transcript:  Microsoft founder Bill Gates is in Sagal in Africa to learn how AI is being used to try and solve the biggest world problems . He's hosted this event called Grand Challenges where he gets together, lots of people with ideas on how to solve these problems .  The Gates Foundation is all about inequity, including in health and some work in education . The foundation is now focusing the foundation on saying, okay, who are the innovators who are thinking about tutoring African students or providing Africans healthC care where the shortage of doctors is worse .  AI can be each student's personal tutor. it can teach them what they need to learn at the exact level they need . The AI can not just create local language textbooks, but also create animated serieses where people are watching people who look like them and sound like them .  Every single year, millions of people who are completely savable are dying, just waiting to be seen . If every single patient had access to an AI chatbot that was trained in medical procedures, they could at least take steps to stop things getting worse . Plus, the added layer for a lot of these countries is they have very low literacy rates .  AI that can have a look through every radiology scan before the doctor's even seen it, which would mean that instead of the doctor starting from scratch effectively, every single time they open up a new scan, they're actually starting from a scan that's already been pre-checked with an AI having gone through and highlighted every single possible risk factor, at which point all the doctor has to do is to go through those risk factors and then decide if they agree or disagree with its assessment  Most of the investment in to AI across the world is happening in rich countries like the US . But a lot of the data that American chatbots are being trained on is US data which can distort the way that the chatbot responds to situations with a US bias .  The foundation will make sure AI gets used for Africa that there's not, you know, a 10 or 20e delay because the AI gets delivered through the cell phone over the mobile network . It's just that in a lot of cases, these normal profit maximizing companies, they don't see any money in poor places like Africa, so they never even try to invest and create solutions for them .  In the case of AI, because the potential for AI is just so massive, you could have a situation where the tools will all be built by the West, for the West . And that is where philanthropy comes in. In the form of grants for new companies who want to start up with the objective of solving these problems .
Title: I made a new Item Sorter in Minecraft | Channel: Mumbo Jumbo | Transcript:  Hermitcraft's base is currently being built on the Hamit craft server . The storage system is going to be traveling through all of these builds . Originally I was going to sort to all of my items manually but then I remembered I'm mumbo-jumbo .  I thought I would filter out a lot of the bulk items, things like cobblestone, stone, various different planks, so that I can reduce the lag of mine carts moving around when I'm doing very basic sorting . With that being said, I definitely don't need to build that in this test . So for now, I'm going to leave it like this. So half of the items from our input are going to arrive in this chest . Half of them are going  The way we're going to make sure that only one type of item ends up in the mine cart. hopper is by using unstackable items in the following four slots . We need all of these designs to be able to work directly next to one another .  We need to use a non-stackable item filter . As soon as we get an unstackable item, we need to tell the hopper mine cart to travel off because it's finished filtering out the items . We then need that non-stacking item to be separated from the items that have been coming from the HPP mine cart .  If I run a two tick pulse into this thing, some more spoons will be removed . But this redstone block shouldn't be able to get stuck over here . I think now it's time to add in all of the extra modules and see if this thing actually functions .  The only thing that it doesn't work with is items stackable up to 16, because you just end up with a full stack . The mine cart is at maximum velocity 8 M, a second and it is reliable regardless of how many items are in sight .  The final thing that I have to add is the filter for a non-stackable items . This should be simple because it is a stripped down version of the other modules . As it's the segment, it doesn't need any of the rail selection stuff or anything like that. We just need to find out when a non .stackable item comes out of the hopper mine cart and then it will move it along .  This is the sort of inventory that would be very frustrating to sort manually you'd be all over the place putting them in all sorts of different chests but this is going to divide up all of the items and organize them for me now i'm also going to do a replica of a regular sorting system over here .  I wanted to be able to leave the chunks on this thing or even leave the game while this thing is running and not run into issues where everything was backing up and things were going totally wrong . So that's why I've kept this as a single or I guess double Minecart system for me personally as someone who is quite impatient and also quite forgetful .
Title: Black Myth: Wukong - Before You Buy | Channel: gameranx | Transcript:  "Black myth: Wukong" is inspired by the 16th century classical Chinese novel "journey to the West" "This is a fairly linearly structured game with some diversions," says Jake Baldino .  You have some stats to worry about, but you're not upgrading like a multitude of stats like endurance and strength and magic and intelligence . Now it's all just focused on the basic level up and simple loot and character progression through a skill tree and some other tricks along the way .  It's just so good to screw over an enemy at the last second..! Sometimes it's tough to learn where exactly a stance might work because enemy attacks are so aggressive . The animations are incredible, but after a while, you might find yourself just doing the same best combos over and over again .  "I didn't really get a good feel for a sense of story," reviewer says . "I was still curious the whole time and had fun seeing cool stuff, but I wasn't like compelled or emotionally invested"  The amount of unique fights in this game feels really, really damn special . The level of challenge to the music and setting, to the like the over the top crazy move sets of some of these enemies . The camera lock on screws up and makes it so you can't see attacks are coming.. this happened to me way more than I'd like .  The game is absolutely gorgeous, flowing rivers, lush foliage, detailed textures, striking shadows and ray tracing . Be warned it's not a soulslike and some souls fans might not love the combat, but they'll like the challenge for sure . I did have some issues, the occasional stuttering, a few glitches with some enemies floating .  "Black Myth: Wukong" is a challenging, thrilling adventure with unique lore setting and vibe and I definitely recommend it at some point, but that's a before you buy, you know how this goes by now, I give you some pros, some cons and some personal opinion . I want to hear yours down in the comments .

Title: "Manchester United always score, but they don't anymore." | The Gary Neville Podcast | Channel: Sky Sports Premier League | Transcript:  Manchester United wilted and were flaky in that second half . They had no idea how to get back in that game . Cristiano Ronaldo's hat-trick lit up the stadium and the fans went home buzzing . But I couldn't help thinking that performance is gonna get you beat on Tuesday . I kept thinking it all night all Sunday they're gonna get beat I never thought for one second before that game I saw a couple of ex-players on the touchline that I played  I still think they could finish fourth whether that's wild . I just have something about them that makes me feel that they'll go and do it . It wouldn't surprise me if I was having a tenner which I don't bet I would probably say I go for United . But I was so disappointed last night I've come out of it today .  Manchester United need a new manager but they also need to look very hard above that very hard . It's unbelievable that Diaz was going to Tottenham he was then going he's then gone to Liverpool there's not even been a mention of him going to Manchester United once United are going to lose Cavani at the end of the season . They're going to need two or three more players in those positions .  The recruitment has been disappointing for a long time, but it's been better in the last two or three years . I don't think anybody at the time thought they were bad signings when they signed Varane or Sancho or Cristiano Ronaldo . But there's also an element of culture and belief and belief that it's a proper football club that does things the best . The owners of Liverpool have created they've created that spirit .
Title: How Does the Stock Market Work? (Stocks, Exchanges, IPOs, and More) | Channel: Concerning Reality | Transcript:  The stock market is often perceived as a big, scary abyss of money that eats unsuspecting investors alive . Understanding the stock market and succeeding and making money with it is far easier than you might expect . A stock is a financial token or instrument that signifies ownership of a company in some proportion .  The modern stock market often bases the value of the company, it's potential earnings down the line . This means that relatively small companies can earn millions or even billions . Stocks allow a company to raise massive amounts of operating capital, with essentially no extra effort or product .  For every stock purchase or sale, there has to be a buyer and a seller . If there are more buyers than the price will go up . If you receive no offers, you'll likely keep dropping the price until someone bites . This is similar to how the stock market moves, except that the price rise and drop isn't done done consciously .  In this video, we've covered the basics of the stock market, how it functions and ways to get started with it . The key thing about stocks is that you can't purchase part of one, it's either all or nothing . We have a link below to start a Robin Hood account where you can get a free stock to download .
Title: How I Blew Up My Chest | Channel: Will Tennyson | Transcript:  A lot of people have massive arms round delts but a chest so flat you're can't hang a painting on it . We want to actually look like you hit the bench not ride it . The benefits of the Smith machine over a regular bench press is you can push Shets much closer to failure and even to failure much more safely .  If you go into the bench press already fatigued from flying, you're going to be weaker . This means less weight on the bar, less tension on the muscle and less overall growth . Studies show if you fatigue your chest before bench press, tricep activation goes up .  Paral reps past failure past failure for every single set of your workout, do it for a couple of movements for the last set maybe the last two sets . Use machines They are amazing for the chest and there's nothing wrong with bringing some toys to the party . At the end of every single rep, I'm pausing, which leads to tip number five .  As humans we're born to be shallow but with the chest we're forced to go deep . If you guys have the camber bar, I highly recommend using it. It's my favorite machine in the entire gym. Not many gyms have it .  You don't need incredibly heavy weight to get a big chest . You need incredibly good technique to get big chest tip number seven . As we're bringing the bar down, we want to reach our chest to the ceiling like we're getting ready for the next load .  You rarely see a guy with a big chest not have massive triceps . Bigger triceps mean a stronger press which just means stronger boobies, bigger boobs . Work on strengthening the tricep and that will help you with the entire range of motion on the bench press .  It's time to address your most primal desires and hit some arms . Do two different chest days in the week, split up the volume, focus on good quality exercises with effective reps, and you will get so much more growth from so much less .  The perfect post-workout meal we don't need any veggies . Could be casted in the next magic mic . Train your chest, eat some chicken breasts, and I'll see you guys in next one .
